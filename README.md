# ANLY-560
For class ANLY 560-51B

This project is an example of Switch Case in Java. The code includes defining 5 grades for a student using float datatype. Then I ahve calculated the vaerage of the 5 grades and stored it in a float variable. The code then defines a final grade for the student using if-else statements on the average student grade calculated previously. 

After the grade is decided, Switch Case statements are used to examine each case of the possible final grades. If it's case A, it prints some message and similarly for each case of final grade it prints a message for the student.
